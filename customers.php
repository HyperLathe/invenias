The cloud based product has evolved rapidly over a short period of time and their development team, consulting with executive search professionals, continues to produce innovative enhancements to the software. This has resulted in a database that adds significant value to our business through superior processes. I look forward to the evolution over the next 12 months and beyond."</p>

The Invenias team that presented to us gave the impression that they genuinely understood the application of data in today’s market and, crucially, our use of that data in servicing our clients. Additionally you want to know that you’re paired with a company where their ambitions and growth plans can sustainably support the growth of your business.”</p>

After 6 months of data collection, analysis of user experiences and a thorough evaluation of the software available in the market we chose Invenias. There are other well-known providers in the marketplace, but we felt that Invenias was the most innovative and intuitive solution available, and 3 months after implementation we have not been disappointed.”</p>

We chose Invenias for three reasons: functionality, cost efficiency, and most importantly the positive experience dealing with the people employed by the firm. I have used numerous systems over the 15 years of search and Invenias beats all of these by a long stretch. The opportunity to buy into a search system at an affordable price for a start-up has been a big help to our business as we grow further. Equally, the training they provide is cost effective and relevant."</p>

We were attracted to Invenias because of the integration with Outlook and Social Media sites. Invenias has more than lived up to our expectations. It was easy to implement, with minimal training needed and has helped us to rapidly grow our business.”</p>

          <h3>James Silverman, Director, Paddington Partners</h3>
          <p>“When we migrated to a new database, I set out to find a partner that understood our needs, saved us time and improved our processes. Invenias is incredibly intuitive so allows us to get new starters up to speed very quickly and the Invenias team are reactive so continue to make developments that improve the functionality and user experience.</p>
          <p>The iPhone and iPad apps have allowed us much greater access to our data while on the move which is incredibly important to Paddington Partners as we expand globally . The opportunity to buy into a system at an affordable price has been a big help to our business as we grow further. Equally, the support provided is excellent wherever you operate around the world.”</p>

We have been long-term ACT Sage users which we grew out of some time ago. We wouldn’t give up the Blackberry until 5 years way past its prime as well. We decided if making a change it would need to be “one and done”. We compared Dillistone’s FileFinder, Cluen and Invenias. The experience from initial request for information, uploading data and questions after install have been nothing less than exceptional with Invenias. Our Account Manager’s knowledge of the system, ability to communicate clearly and personal approach were so appreciated. At the end of the day, Invenias intuitive functionality, complete effectiveness and use of data are why we went with the system. To have the same individual sell you the product, help you through uploading and remain your contact after the sale...PRICELESS!"</p>
